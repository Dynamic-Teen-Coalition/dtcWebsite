      "At IGF 2022 in Ethiopia, 14-year-old Pyrate Ruby Passell asked why there were no teens in the UN 'Youth' track. That single question disrupted a global system built on the outdated belief that 'youth' begins at 18, erasing teen voices entirely. She joined the IGF 2023 Youth Planning Committee while contributing to the Global Digital Compact. As part of the UN Foundation's inaugural Engine Room cohort, she advanced teen roles in digital governance across multiple UN platforms. When the IGF Secretariat asked her to create a Teen Dynamic Coalition in 2023, we built a teen movement that launched in March 2024.",
